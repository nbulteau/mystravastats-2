# MyStravaStats-2

A tool to calculate and display various statistics on Strava activities.

## Features

This tool scans through activities and provides the following statistics:

* **Best Effort**: Finds the fastest consecutive 1 km, 5 km, 10 km you've run, or the fastest 2 hours, 3 hours in ride activities.
* **Eddington Number**: Calculates the Eddington number for rides, runs, inline skating, and hikes. The Eddington number is the largest number, E, such that you have ridden at least E km on at least E days. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington#Eddington_number_for_cycling)
* **Best Cooper (12 min)**: Finds the best effort for the given time (12 minutes) on running activities using a 'sliding window'. [Learn more](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_de_Cooper)
* **Best vVO2max (6 min)**: Finds the best effort for the given time (6 minutes) on running activities using a 'sliding window'. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VVO2max)
* **FTP (Functional Threshold Power)**: Finds the best effort for the given time (1 hour) on bike activities using a 'sliding window'. The easiest way to calculate your FTP is to test your best average power for 20 minutes and then subtract 5%.

And many other statistics.

All statistics can be exported as a CSV file.

### Strava Access

All calls to the Strava API require an `access_token` defining the athlete and application making the call. Any registered Strava user can obtain an `access_token` by first creating an application at [Strava API Settings](https://www.strava.com/settings/api).

The Strava API application settings page provides *mandatory parameters* for MyStravaStats:

* `clientId`: Your applicationâ€™s ID.
* `clientSecret`: Your client secret.

Create a directory `strava-cache` with a `.strava` file in it. Put your `clientId` and `clientSecret` in the file.

```shell
mkdir strava-cache
cd strava-cache
echo "clientId=[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]" > .strava
echo "clientSecret=[YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET]" >> .strava
export STRAVA_CACHE_PATH=$(pwd)
```

### Get activities from Strava

Activities are download in a local directory (strava-cache), in that way only new and missing ones are downloaded from Strava.
The first time you use My Strava Stats it will attempt to collect activities from 2010 to now.
Due to rate limitations (100 requests every 15 minutes, with up to 1,000 requests per day) it may be necessary to do it
in several attempts. (<https://developers.strava.com/docs/rate-limits/>)

Note : If you do not provide your Client Secret MyStravaStats will use locally downloaded activities.

A browser will open a browser on the Strava consent screen.
If browser does not open, copy/past URL from your terminal in a browser to allow mystravastats to access your Strava
data.
This URL will look like :

```link
https://www.strava.com/api/v3/oauth/authorize?client_id=[YOUR_CLIENT_ID]&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/exchange_token&approval_prompt=force&scope=read_all,profile:read_all,activity:read_all
```

Login to Strava then click 'Authorize' and tick the required permissions if needed.

## build command

You need to have docker on your computer : it prevent you to install all the developpment environement stuffs.

Launch the proper script :

### MacOS

```shell
./build-macos.zsh
```

### Ubuntu

```shell
./build-ubuntu.sh
```

ðŸ”„ Change owner of mystravastats to current user: 'sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) mystravastats'"

```shell
sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) mystravastats
````

### Windows

```shell
./build-windows.ps1
```

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Before running the run command, you need to set the `STRAVA_CACHE_PATH` environment variable. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:

```shell
STRAVA_CACHE_PATH=[path to the strava-cache directory]
```

You can use .env file

```shell
echo STRAVA_CACHE_PATH=[path to the strava-cache directory] > .env
docker compose build
```

## run command

Launch the proper script :

### MacOS or Ubuntu

```shell
./mystravastats
```

### Windows

```shell
mystravastats.exe
```

Open link in a browser : <http://localhost:8080/>
